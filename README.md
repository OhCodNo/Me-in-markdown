# **Introduction**
HELLO! It is Cod, or Atro, or any other name you want to call me (If you're my friend of course). I am a beginner coder! 

What do I do ya probably don't ask EVER in your life? Well I'm glad you DIDN'T ASK! 

I work on Drawing, making stuff like books, voice acting (Currently auditioning Noli in an upcoming roblox game). I enjoy spending time with my dogs, working on characters, and watching different shows on my television.

My most recent creation is a recreation of Project moon's library of Ruina inside the roblox studio software, I haven't coded anything official yet but it's getting there! Currently 3 of the floors are finished, this being the floor of history, floor of technological sciences, and floor of literature which also is home to the ballin of Ruina meme. I'm also working on a fanmade undertale bossfight known as Ecotale. 

My favorite games? Well I do play deltarune, Limbus company, L corp (I'm never playing that again), Roblox, Helldivers 2, and Baldurs gate 3! 
(Proud user of Oathbreaking paladins.)
My favorite shows are Murder drones, TADC, Sakamoto days, and The Underverse.
